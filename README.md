# rideclique-microservices
RideClique is an application that used by people on the Car Community in Indonesia. And at this moment I've build the sample of the microservices of the application.

## Clone the project and initialized on your local computer.
Clone it's simple because this same like other repository, but different how to running.
```javascript
$ git clone https://github.com/fuaditrockz/rideclique-microservices.git
$ cd <each-folder>
$ npm install //do this on all folder.
```

## Running at the first.
At the first you must run the gateway project to start all of the project. Because I make all of the endpoints integrate on one gate that is `localhost:8080`.

```javascript
$ cd rideclique-microservices
$ cd rideclique-gateway
$ npm start
```
