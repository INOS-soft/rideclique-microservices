# rideclique-microservices
RideClique is an application that used by people on the Car Community in Indonesia. And at this moment I've build the sample of the microservices of the application.

## Running at the first
At the first you must run the gateway project to start all of the project. Because I make all of the endpoints integrate on one gate that is `localhost:8080`.

```javascript
$ cd rideclique-microservices
$ cd rideclique-gateway
$ npm start
```
